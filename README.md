## üìã Description

This application is a comprehensive facial analysis tool built with OpenCV, DeepFace, and Streamlit. It provides advanced capabilities for face detection, facial feature recognition, face comparison, and face recognition with identity management.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes OpenCV's DNN module for accurate face detection in images and video streams
- **Feature Detection:** Identifies facial features like eyes and smiles using Haar Cascade classifiers
- **Attribute Analysis:** Estimates age, gender, and emotion using DeepFace's pre-trained models
- **Face Comparison:** Compares faces between images using both HOG features and neural embedding models
- **Face Recognition:** Registers and recognizes facial identities with a persistent database
- **Real-time Processing:** Works with both static images and live camera feeds

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Streamlit:** Interactive web interface
- **OpenCV:** Computer vision algorithms and video processing
- **DeepFace:** Deep learning models for facial analysis
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Deep learning framework
- **NumPy/Pandas:** Data processing and manipulation
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning utilities
